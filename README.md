Time series analysis is a fundamental task in many real-world applications, such as finance, healthcare, and transportation. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in time series analysis. This repository aims to collect the resources related to GNNs for time series analysis (GNN4TS).

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/taxonomy.png" width="1200">
</p>

We provide two taxonomies for GNN4TS. The first taxonomy (left) is task-oriented and the second taxonomy (right) is model-oriented. The task-oriented taxonomy is based on the tasks that GNNs are used for in time series analysis. The model-oriented taxonomy is based on the types of GNNs used in time series analysis.
